# kezs-portfolio-website



# Description:

I created my portfolio website to display all my projects I have been working on in class and outside of class. I included the programming languages: HTML and CSS.

# Installation
I used VS code to create my website, and then Github to deploy it.

# Usage

Whenever someone goes on my website they are first landing on the homepage. From there they can scroll down to see my Home Page, About me, My Projects and Contact info. What's neat is my navbar. By clicking the buttons on my navbar, they are directed to the specific section they want to visit. Most importantly, I linked all my contact info (social medias and business platforms) incase a future employer wants to reach out to me.
